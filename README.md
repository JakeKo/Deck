# Deck [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JakeKo/Deck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JakeKo/Deck)
Deck is an open-source, well-armed, safe-to-swallow, and fluoride-free application for editing and presenting slide decks.

# Technology Stack
The application makes heavy use of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), a hip, modern component-based JS framework (much like React or Angular). Vue is used in conjunction with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and few helpful plugins to encourage object-oriented component design. For testing Vue components, the project uses [MochaJS](https://mochajs.org/). Finally, to transpile, bundle, and minify all of the project assets, Deck uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

# Contributing
Want to contribute? Great! We're happy to have you on board. Fortunately, Deck is pretty lightweight so there are only three steps to start local development:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` 

This will spin up a local copy of Deck that you may use to add a feature or address a bug. Once you are ready to submit your changes, simply file a pull request and include @JakeKo as a reviewer.
